# prototype-login-page


note: this is a simple prototype for a react application for the functionalities of a login app. 

To use this, just do the following:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn`
3. run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

After this, the login page will be rendered in the '/' route.


Notes:
- The login credentials are hardcoded and they are:
userName
password
respectively.

- On successful login, you will be redirected to google to signify that your log in is successful, unsuccessful logins will receive an error message.

- This does not reflect precisely the precise layout of the login page as there will still be artistic propositions to consider.
